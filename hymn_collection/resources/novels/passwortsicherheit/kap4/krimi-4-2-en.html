  Indeed, Patrick's phone rang two days later, and the inspector invited him to
  the crime scene.
</p>
<p>
  When he arrived, she was already waiting for him. Also present were several
  uniformed officers and three people that were introduced to him as additional
  witnesses: Arnold Janssen, the deceased's supervisor at the IT company where
  he managed important business clients, Birgit Kornfelder, the managing
  director of one of those companies and its contact person for Xaver Yaris, and
  finally Erwin Landmann, Yaris's best friend since childhood. All three had had
  contact with Yaris on the day before his untimely demise and were to help
  reconstruct his last hours.
</p>
<p>
  What they didn't know: the inspector had asked Patrick beforehand to describe
  only the original position of the body and how he had moved it, but not to
  mention the USB stick. She suspected all three witnesses and hoped that the
  culprit might reveal themselves, believing Patrick would not have mentioned
  the stick to the police out of shame.

<p>
  "Cool," Patrick said excitedly. "Like in an Agatha Christie novel: all
  suspects gathered, and the culprit is revealed. Of course, I'll help!"
</p>
<p>
  Patrick explained exactly how he had found the deceased and demonstrated with
  the help of one of the officers how the body had been lying on the desk and
  how he had propped it up. He also mentioned how he had been startled by the
  groaning noise and fled the house in panic. Following instructions, he did not
  mention the USB stick. However, he did point out that there had been a laptop
  on the table, which was now gone.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the inspector closely observed the reactions of the other
  witnesses. Since she did not notice anything incriminating, she went on the
  offensive: "Too bad we don't know what data got Mr. Yaris into trouble. The
  fact that the computer was stolen suggests it must have been sensitive
  information. Does anyone here have any idea what it could have been?"
</p>
<p>She looked around questioningly.</p>

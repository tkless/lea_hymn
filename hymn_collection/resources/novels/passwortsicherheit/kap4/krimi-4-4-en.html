<h2>XY... Solved!</h2>
<br />
<p>
  "I do," a voice from outside said firmly, and everyone turned around. Standing
  in the doorway was Grandma Erika, who had come along at Patrick's request and
  had been observing the scene from a distance.
</p>
<p>
  "Because I know my grandson and because I now know who did it," she added with
  a smile.
</p>
<p>"Oh, who then?" the inspector asked. "And how do you know?"</p>
<p>
  "Well," Erika Podwig explained calmly. "Pat says someone laid in wait for him
  at the crime scene, and bumped him so hard that they could search and take the
  stick from his pocket. Pat couldn't see the attacker because they came from
  behind, but to overwhelm him like that – this lady is indeed too petite. I
  also wouldn't trust a desk worker like the victim's boss to do such a thing.
  But mostly, I wonder how the other man got the idea to call Pat a 'metalhead.'
  He claims to have seen him for the first time today, and Patrick is now
  wearing his late grandfather's old loden jacket that I gave him because his
  hoodie was covered with blood. Only the murderer, who hid in the room, could
  have seen him that morning in the AC/DC hoodie."
</p>
<p>
  "Damn it!" Erwin Landmann exclaimed. "First, the stupid stick is re-encrypted
  so I can't open it, and now, after I sent Xaver down the 'Highway to Hell, I
  get caught because of that dumb jacket.' But the traitor deserved it. After
  all, we planned the deal with the customer data together, and then he tried to
  double-cross me, grinning as he told me that he wrote everything on a stick
  that only he could read. I even had suggested the password idea when I saw his
  screensaver. I could have cracked that easily, but the kid must have done
  something different with it."
</p>
<p>
  "Thank you," the inspector exclaimed, and it wasn't entirely clear whether she
  meant the culprit's confession or Erika Podwig's deduction. "Mr. Landmann, you
  are hereby arrested on suspicion of murdering Xaver Yaris."
</p>
<p>
  She turned to her uniformed colleagues. "Please take Mr. Landmann away. He
  won't be getting out of our custody with any password anytime soon."
</p>
<p>
  Finally, she patted Patrick on the shoulder and congratulated him heartily.
</p>
<p>
  "Well, young man, everything turned out well in the end, and the trick with
  the stick worked. The culprit probably still has it with him, and if not,
  we'll find it at his home. But you'll have to tell us the new password. You
  still remember it, don’t you...?"
</p>
<p>
  "Of course," Patrick laughed, glancing at his grandma. "I definitely learned a
  thing or two on this crazy adventure."

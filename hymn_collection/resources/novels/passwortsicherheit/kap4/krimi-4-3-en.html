<h2>Whodunit?</h2>

  "Well," Arnold Janssen began hesitantly. He adjusted his dark blue jacket with
  slightly padded shoulders, which he wore over a white shirt with an open
  collar. "One shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but Mr. Yaris was suspected of
  leaking our clients' trade secrets for several months. We first investigated
  internally to avoid causing a stir if it turned out to be unfounded.
  Unfortunately, we were only at the beginning of our investigation, and now we
  may never know if the suspicion would have been confirmed."
</p>
<p>
  "Our trade secrets?!" Birgit Kornfelder hissed, a small, slim woman in a gray
  business suit with blond hair pinned up. "And you didn't think it necessary to
  inform us? What if it was true and I had entrusted him with more material that
  he could have sold to our competitors? I'm seriously considering ending our
  business relationship with your company."
</p>
<p>
  "I see," the inspector said with a smile. Her provocative question seemed to
  be bearing fruit. "That gives you both a strong motive for murder. And we know
  all present were in this room on the day of or shortly before the crime. You,
  Mr. Janssen, could have confronted Mr. Yaris. Maybe he threatened that if you
  exposed him, he would ruin your company's reputation. As we've just heard from
  Ms. Kornfelder, this fear wasn't unfounded. And you..." She turned to the
  just-mentioned lady, "could have learned about Mr. Yaris' theft of your trade
  secrets and reacted just as strongly as you did now. Either way, it was likely
  a crime of passion, where someone grabbed the letter opener lying around in
  anger and... bamâ€”end of the story!"
</p>
<p>
  She looked challengingly at the accused, who both expressed their indignation.
</p>
<p>
  "Or maybe you caught your old friend spying?" the inspector suddenly turned to
  Erwin Landmann, surprising everyone. "He felt caught, a fight ensued and, in
  the heat of the moment, you suddenly had the letter opener in your hand...
  After all, you have a prior conviction for assault."
</p>
<p>Now, all three spoke wildly over each other.</p>
<p>
  "Typical police!" Landmann started ranting. His face turned red under his
  thick beard. "Once you've made one mistake, you're branded for life. Why don't
  you suspect this little metalhead here? Maybe he caught Xaver stealing data
  and stabbed him when he noticed and tried to stop him from snitching."
</p>
<p>
  "Exactly!" Arnold Janssen agreed. "I certainly didn't do it. Our internal
  investigation was already underway. If and once we had found something, we
  would have handled it more discreetly than with a murder."
</p>
<p>
  "And I would have definitely reported the guy," Birgit Kornfelder added.
  "Maybe I would have slapped him, but I wouldn't kill anyone. And besides, I'm
  much too weak for a tussle with such a strong man."
</p>
<p>
  "Alright," the inspector called out loudly. "Now everyone calm down. You all
  had the opportunity and a motive. Including you," she added to Patrick's
  dismay, pointing at him. "Who says you didn't just invent the story about the
  stolen USB stick because you now want to sell it yourself?"

<h2>Embarrassing Interrogation</h2>
<br />
<p>
  Shyly, Patrick entered the police station accompanied by his grandmother.
  Unlike practically every crime series on TV, you couldn't just walk through
  but had to sign in at a front desk where an officer sat behind (presumably
  bulletproof) glass, taking down personal details before the visitors could
  state their business.
</p>
<p>
  After the officer at the reception made a brief phone call, they were soon
  picked up by a woman, presumably in her late thirties and in plain clothes,
  who led them through a security door, into the stairwell and into her office.
  She introduced herself as the lead inspector of the murder commission. She had
  taken over the investigation after the police were alerted by a neighbor who
  had found Xaver Yaris's body when he noticed the open door on his way to work.
</p>
<p>
  The inspector listened attentively to Patrick's account while Grandma Erika
  kept discreetly in the background.
</p>
<p>
  "Patrick... may I address you with your first name?" the inspector began and
  continued when Patrick nodded briefly. "You realize you behaved quite
  clumsily?"
</p>
<p>Patrick nodded again.</p>
<p>
  "I'm not blaming you for your panicked reaction, but if you had called us
  right away instead of conducting your own investigation..." The inspector
  broke off and threw a reproachful look at Grandma Erika. "Then we wouldn't
  have been hunting for someone who apparently moved the body after the murder
  and left a lot of fingerprints. (We will have to send you to the lab later for
  fingerprint matching.) Moreover, we would now have a memory stick with
  important information."
</p>
<p>
  "...and possibly another corpse," countered Grandma Erika. "You heard him; the
  murderer was still in the house."
</p>
<p>
  "...the boy assumes," the inspector said unmoved. "But no matter! At least you
  reported it now and saved us further false leads."
</p>
<p>
  "And provided valuable information," Grandma Erika said confidently. "After
  all, we decrypted the data on the stick."
</p>
<p>"...and then had it taken from you!"</p>
<p>
  "But we re-encrypted the data," Patrick proudly added. "Even if the
  perpetrator knew the old password or might have cracked it, he will definitely
  have a hard time with the new one."
</p>
<p>
  "From your lips to God's ears!" the inspector sighed, stretching in her chair.
</p>
<p>
  "What was in it?" she asked, now addressing Erika Podwig. Erika tried to list
  the names and addresses she could remember and describe the numbers associated
  with them. She also voiced her suspicion that it might be a case of industrial
  espionage. The inspector listened attentively and occasionally took a few
  notes.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, she dismissed them and announced that she would contact Patrick again
  in the next few days to revisit the crime scene with him and to reconstruct
  the discovery of the body.

<h2>Grandma is the Best</h2>
<br />

<p>
  After cycling through the city, through streets and alleys, between bollards,
  and through narrow connecting paths – hoping to lose any possible pursuers –
  Patrick stopped exhausted, panting, and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
</p>
<p>
  "What do I do now?" he asked himself desperately. If he called the police now,
  they would ask why he left the crime scene and why he entered the house at
  all. Well, he might still have a good explanation for that. But not an
  explanation for the USB stick, which he just remembered was in his pocket.
</p>
<p>
  He briefly considered turning to his parents, but like many teenagers, he had
  a somewhat strained relationship with them lately and feared their lecturing
  even more than police interrogation. He then thought of his grandma—a
  sympathetic and pretty cool old lady, whom he had always gotten along with
  quite well and who had given him quite a few helpful tips here and there. So
  he fished out his phone and dialed her number.
</p>
<p>
  "Pick up!" Patrick thought, and each ringing beep made his anxiousness grow.
  But then a crackling sound relieved him, followed by Grandma Erika's friendly
  voice.
</p>
<p>
  "Hello Pat," she greeted him cheerfully. Obviously, she had saved his
  cell-phone number in her contacts and recognized him immediately. "Nice of you
  to call. How are you?"
</p>
<p>
  "Not so good right now," Patrick replied awkwardly and told his grandmother
  the essentials in a few sentences.
</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea what I should do now?" he asked after his account.</p>
<p>
  "Actually, the police would be a good idea," she replied hesitantly, "but if
  you're too worried about that, then come over and we'll figure it out
  together."
</p>
<p>
  "Thank you," Patrick sighed with relief, as that was the answer he had hoped
  for. Grandma was really cool. No reproaches, no lecturing, and certainly no
  panic.
</p>
<p>
  "Okay," he said, looking around to get his bearings. "I should be at your
  place in about half an hour."
</p>
<p>
  Then he got back on his bike and headed to the part of town where Grandma
  Erika lived in an apartment with her budgie "Pitti," a pet parakeet.
</p>
<p>
  Twenty minutes later, Patrick stood in front of the gate of the residential
  complex, which consisted of an eight-story double high-rise surrounded by a
  sprawling lawn with a few narrow flowerbeds. Grandma Erika lived on the front
  building’s fourth floor.
</p>
<p>
  He carefully placed his bike in a corner of the sunken basement entrance so it
  was neither visible from the street nor the entrance, while also not seriously
  obstruct access to the basement. Then he pressed the doorbell next to the name
  "E. Podwig" and waited patiently until a crackling speaker voice asked, "Pat,
  is that you?"
</p>
<p>
  "Yes, Grandma," he answered briefly and waited for the buzzing of the door
  opener. But instead, another scratchy question came:
</p>
<p>"What is your mother's middle name?"</p>
<p>"Maria," Pat replied, puzzled.</p>
<p>
  "Okay," the intercom crackled. "It's really you." The redeeming buzz followed,
  and Patrick pushed the door open.
</p>
<p>"What was that about Mom's middle name?" Pat asked after a warm greeting.</p>
<p>
  "Just making sure it's you and not some possible pursuer," Grandma Erika
  replied as if it were a matter of course. "Didn't your parents ever read you
  'Little Red Riding Hood'? The grandmother doesn't come off very well because
  she's too gullible."
</p>
<p>"Could it be that you're a bit paranoid?" Patrick asked, frowning.</p>
<p>
  "Who found a corpse while delivering newspapers and who fled head-over-heels
  from the suspected murderer—you or me?" came Grandma's immediate response.
</p>
<p>
  "Yes, well, I get it," Patrick conceded. "'It's me' could have been said by
  anyone."
</p>
<p>
  "Exactly," Grandma confirmed. "Nice that you understand so quickly. But come
  in first. Would you like a cup of tea or juice? And take off your sweatshirt.
  It's got blood on it."
</p>
<p>
  Patrick had not even noticed that the sleeves of the tour hoodie his uncle had
  given him were smeared with the blood of the murder victim. "That must have
  happened when I propped up the body," he thought, pulling the hoodie over his
  head, carefully avoiding further soiling his clothes.
  <br />
  "But be careful," he said as he handed the jacket to Grandma. "Uncle Fritz
  said this sweatshirt is valuable . It's from AC/DC's last European tour."
  <br />
  "I know," Grandma Erika reassured. "After all, I was at the concert with
  Friedrich."

<h2>A Corpse in the Morning Spoils Your Day</h2>

<p>
  Nothing could be more peaceful than suburban streets in the early morning.
  When the last night owls had long since arrived home and even the cats had
  ended their nocturnal prowling, everything was empty and quiet. At most, one
  could occasionally hear the distant, isolated calls of birds preparing to
  greet the morning as the first rays of sunlight cautiously peeked from behind
  the houses.
</p>

<p>
  Being so early in the morning, no one was around. No one except Patrick Podwig
  on his sturdy work bicycle, whose saddle bags, adorned with bright
  advertisements, were filled with freshly printed newspapers. On the left side,
  the "Tagesbote," on the right, the "Anzeiger" and the "Rundschau" — clearly
  distinguishable by their different formats and easily retrieved with a
  practiced grip. Fifteen-year-old Patrick, who liked to be called "Pat" by his
  friends, loved his job. Patrickdelivered newspapers to earn a little pocket
  money before school started, and he performed it diligently. He had memorized
  the list of his customers' names, addresses, and newspaper subscriptions, so
  it usually took him no more than a quick reach into the right bag to pull out
  the morning paper, fold or roll it carefully, and deliver it to the
  corresponding residence. If the newspaper boxes were at the front gate, he
  didn't even have to get off his bike. But he also liked walking the usually
  paved and neatly weed-free paths to the front doors with the springy step that
  youth and his air-cushioned sneakers gave him. Only when mailboxes did not
  have a separate newspaper compartment, or ifthey still contained the previous
  day's letters, did he have to alter his routine to insert the newspaper
  without damage. But from his regular route experience, he already knew where
  to expect such possible complications. So he pedaled cheerfully along the
  empty street, enjoying the morning freshness blowing into his face while his
  AC/DC hoodie kept his ears warm.
</p>

<p>
  The next address on the list belonged to Xaver Yaris. A grin usually sneaked
  onto Patrick’s face every time when he readthe name since it becomes "XY" when
  abbreviated, giving it a mysterious air. He had never actually met Mr. Yaris
  in person, like most of his customers, but in his imagination he looked a bit
  like James Bond. Not Daniel Craig, convincing as he was in the role of the
  tough secret agent, but the good old Sean Connery Bond: tough and a bit
  roguish with always a cool smile on his lips.
</p>

<p>
  XY was one of those customers for whom Pat had to get off his bike. The
  newspaper box was not at the garden gate, but instead next to the front door.
  And this—Patrick noticed with surprise as he pushed the rolled-up newspaper
  into the tube—was ajar.
</p>

<p>
  For a moment, Patrick considered ignoring the open door and continuing his
  round, but then he decided to better check it out. He knocked cautiously and
  listened. After waiting in vain for a reaction, he knocked a little louder and
  called into the house, "Is everything alright?" Shortly thereafter, he thought
  he heard a faint groan. He called again, "Do you need help?" and then shortly
  after, "I'm coming in now!"
</p>

<p>
  Patrick entered the house and first oriented himself in the spacious hallway.
  All the adjoining doors were neatly closed. All but one. Patrick peeked
  through the crack and looked into a study. He pushed the door open just enough
  to slip through and entered the room.
</p>

<p>
  A slumped figure sat at a desk in an ergonomically shaped gaming chair, facing
  an open laptop. Moving to the desk, Patrick saw that the screen saver
  displayed a yellow network growing through a labyrinth.
</p>

<p>"Mr. Yaris ..."</p>

<p>
  Patrick tentatively shook the man lying halfway on the desk, first gently and
  then a bit more firmly. When the addressedthe man did not move, Pat grabbed
  him with both hands from behind by the shoulders with both hands, hoisted him
  up, and leaned him against the backrest of the gaming chair. He had to exert
  more effort than expected, especially since Xaver Yaris had the figure of a
  fast-food junkie rather than a wiry secret agent. No James Bond, Patrick
  thought, a little disappointed.
</p>

<p>
  If he had hoped that the man would wake up from his action, this expectation
  was also not met. The head fell back against the headrest with a jerk and
  remained motionless. Patrick walked around the chair ... and screamed in
  horror as he looked into two staring, dead eyes. The man's T-shirt was covered
  in blood, and a letter opener protruded from his chest.
</p>

<p>
  When Pat had regained some composure, he fumbled with trembling fingers into
  the depths of his pant’s pocket for his phone to call the police. But before
  he could get a good grip on it, he was shocked again. The corpse's forearm,
  which had been lying on the edge of the desk, slid off. The previously
  clenched fist opened and a small object fell out. Reflexively, Pat picked it
  up and recognized it as a USB stick.
</p>

<p>
  At that moment, he heard a noise from somewhere in the house, close. Startled,
  he looked around but could not see anything that would indicate the cause. The
  noise sounded somehow familiar, and suddenly it hit him. What he had just
  heard resembled the groan that had prompted him to enter the house. And since
  the man at the desk had obviously been dead for a while, it could only mean
  one thing: the murderer was still in the house and hiding somewhere!
</p>

<p>
  Panic-stricken, Pat ran out of the room, out of the house, and onto the
  street. There he jumped on his bike and rode off, aimlessly, away from there
  and as fast and as far as possible!
</p>

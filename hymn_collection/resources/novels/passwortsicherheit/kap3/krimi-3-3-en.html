  After logging off the computer properly, Grandma Erika pulled out the USB
  stick and handed it ceremoniously to Patrick, who immediately put it in his
  pocket. Then she stood up with a groan and shuffled toward the wardrobe.
</p>
<p>"One moment. I'll just put something on..."</p>

<p>
  "No need, Grandma!" Patrick protested indignantly. "I'm really grateful for
  your help, but I'd rather arrive at the police without an escort. It would
  just be too embarrassing. And besides, I'm much faster on my bike."
</p>
<p>
  "If you think so." Grandma stopped on her way through the apartment and
  shrugged. "But if you're biking, you need a jacket. You can't go to the police
  in the blood-stained hoodie. Somewhere, I still have an old loden jacket from
  your grandpa. It's a bit heavy, but wind- and waterproof. Now it's good I
  couldn't part with it."
</p>
<p>
  She changed direction and headed to her bedroom with the large closet Patrick
  always liked to hide in as a little kid. Shortly after, she returned carrying
  a thick, dark gray coat-like garment over her arm. As she put the coat on her
  grandson, he noticed how heavy the dense fabric was, very much unlike typical
  modern fibers. But he was young and strong and wore his grandfather's jacket
  with pride.
</p>
<p>
  Patrick quickly said goodbye, ran down the stairs, and got on his bike. He was
  about to ride off when he realized he had no idea where the nearest police
  station was. He considered googling it but then remembered he had not finished
  his delivery route due to the hasty escape from the crime scene. That would
  certainly cause trouble, and he didn't want to lose his job. Only five
  newspapers were left in the saddlebag. Maybe he could quickly deliver those
  now. After all, it was still relatively early in the morning, and, if he was
  lucky, the police were already at the crime scene, securing evidence. He could
  then immediately speak to someone on site.
</p>
<p>
  When he arrived at the crime scene, Patrick was disappointed to find no police
  car or people in white full-body suits. Either the crime hadn't been
  discovered by anyone else yet, or the police had already left. But since he
  was there, he might as well quickly deliver the remaining newspapers. He
  parked his bike, fished two "Tagesboten" out of the saddlebag, and headed to
  the house across the street.
</p>
<p>
  He had almost reached the garden gate when he saw a dark shadow approaching
  from the back. Before he could react, a heavy body rammed him with such force
  that he stumbled and hit a gate post. The hard impact could have easily broken
  a few ribs, but Grandpa's loden jacket was as strong as armor and prevented
  the worst. Still, he staggered around, dazed, and had to lean against the
  post. Just as he was about to stand up, a heavy blow to the back of his head
  knocked him out.
</p>
<p>
  When he regained consciousness a bit later and tried to stand, he shook
  briefly and immediately regretted it. The surroundings blurred before his
  eyes. So he decided to half-rise and lean against the post until he could
  think clearly again. When he finally felt ready, he checked his wallet, keys,
  and phone, and was equally pleased and surprised to find everything still in
  place.
</p>
<p>Everything except the USB stick!</p>
<p>"You stupid fool, fool, fool!" echoed in his head.</p>
<p>
  For some reason, the murderer must have expected, or at least hoped, he would
  return to the crime scene and had lain in wait for him.
</p>
<p>
  But how had he recognized him? He couldn't have seen his face since Patrick
  had kept his hood up in the house. And he wasn't wearing the conspicuous AC/DC
  jacket anymore. But then his gaze fell on the bike he had parked across the
  street. The bright advertisement on the saddlebags was unmistakable. That must
  have given him away.
</p>
<p>
  Pain, dizziness, shame, and anger danced wildly behind Patrick's forehead.
  Should he really have expected the murderer to lay in wait for several hours
  near the crime scene, hoping the only witness would return before the police
  cordoned everything off? The stick must be really important to him!
</p>
<p>
  But anyway, for Patrick Podwig, the situation didn’t look good at all at the
  moment. His ﬁngerprints were in the house, the victim's blood on his jacket,
  he was injured, and the evidence he had taken was lost. Damn!
</p>
<p>
  In the face of this dire situation, he had no choice but to pull out his phone
  and dial his grandma's number again.
</p>
<p>
  "Hello Pat," he heard her voice, sounding slightly surprised. "Have they let
  you go already? That was quick. So—is everything alright?"
</p>
<p>
  "Unfortunately not," Patrick stammered awkwardly. "I think I really screwed
  up. It wasn't such a good idea to go alone after all." Then he updated Grandma
  Erika.
</p>
<p>
  Shortly after, a taxi pulled up next to Patrick, who was waiting by his bike.
  From inside, Grandma Erika waved. She rolled down the window and called to
  him, "Come on, lock your bike and get in. We're going to the police station
  together. Or do you need to go to the hospital first?"
</p>
<p>
  Patrick shook his head cautiously. It still caused slight dizziness, but was
  bearable.
</p>
<p>"No," he said. "It's fine. Let's get this over with."</p>

<h2>The Trick with the Stick</h2>
<br />
<p>
  "Now we really need to turn this stick over to the police," Grandma Erika said
  firmly. "The next steps for solving the crime are beyond our competences."
</p>
<p>
  Patrick's lips twisted in slight disappointment. Somehow he had secretly hoped
  to avoid the unpleasant questioning by the police, even though it had been
  clear to him from the start that there was no way around it.
</p>
<p>Grandma noticed his sullen expression and immediately understood.</p>
<p>
  "We can't avoid the police. You knew that from the beginning, right? And the
  longer we wait, the worse it gets, because by now they probably have found
  your fingerprints and maybe even DNA in the apartment. If you don't report
  yourself before they find you, you might even become a suspect. But at least
  now we have something to offer."
</p>
<p>
  She pointed meaningfully at the stick protruding from the computer like the
  letter opener... Patrick shook off the vision in horror.
</p>
<p>
  "But first, we should secure the data," Grandma Erika continued. "And in a way
  that they aren't easily decrypted."
</p>
<p>"And how do we do that?" Patrick asked, intrigued.</p>
<p>
  "As you saw, the best password is still insecure if it is derived from a
  single word, even if it's then enriched by a standard method with numbers and
  special characters. Better are passwords generated by special password
  generators. There's no recognizable pattern in the switch between
  differentdiﬀerent character types. But unfortunately, such passwords are also
  very hard to remember, and as I explained about hashing, if you have multiple
  different ones you can easily get confused. What's important is that your code
  has a certain minimum length—15 characters should be enough for today and the
  foreseeable next few years—which includes as many different character types as
  possible without any recognizable pattern. So the best method to create secure
  and memorable encryption keys is to use passPHRASES instead of passWORDS."
</p>
<p>"Phrases like 'The early bird catches the worm'?"</p>
<p>
  "Already quite good, but still too short because we only use the initial
  letters. From the sentence, the passphrase would be: 'TEBCtW'. It already
  includes uppercase and lowercase letters, but it's only six characters
  long—easily cracked by modern computers with simple brute force."
</p>
<p>
  "For that phrase, there's an extension," Patrick laughed: "'...but the second
  mouse gets the cheese.'"
</p>
<p>
  "That's much better, especially because it also adds punctuation and a number:
  'TEBCtW,bt2MGtC'."
</p>
<p>
  "However, I've read that mice actually don't like cheese, but are more likely
  caught with bacon," Pat added eagerly.
</p>
<p>
  "That's even better," Grandma exclaimed enthusiastically, "because it modifies
  the well-known phrase individually. Maybe we can also add an exclamation mark
  at the end. Then we'd have: 'TEBCtW,bt2MGtB!'. There could be more numbers,
  and the punctuation at the end isn't quite surprising, but the length and
  combination itself are important because password-cracking programs can't
  solve individual parts independently like a safe-cracker or like the old
  hangman game. It either fits or it doesn't. And with your code, we're already
  very good—and you won't forget it easily."
</p>
<p>
  "Definitely not!" Patrick confirmed and watched as his grandmother
  re-encrypted the data on the stick, finally sealing it with the new password.

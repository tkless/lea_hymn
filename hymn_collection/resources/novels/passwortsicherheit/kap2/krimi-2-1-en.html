  "Now, let's see what you brought," said Grandma after she had finished a cup
  of loose-brewed tea while Patrick had a glass of orange juice.

  Pat handed her the USB stick, and she turned on her computer. After logging in
  with her user account, she immediately started a program that opened another
  operating system within the initial one. "Just a precaution," she said without
  looking up. "A virtual machine as a sandbox. You never know what you might
  bring into your home with such a foreign stick."
</p>
<p>
  Then she looked at Patrick, and seeing his puzzled face, she added, "An
  operating system within an operating system. If the stick installs any
  malicious programs, they stay trapped in the inner system and can't infect my
  computer. Shutting down the virtual machine then completely deletes them
  without causing any damage. It's a bit like a virtual sandbox where kids can
  play without making a mess outside."

  "Got it," said Pat, who still didn't quite understand but knew Grandma had it
  under control. After all, she was almost one of the founding members of the
  "Chaos Computer Club." "Almost" meant she joined shortly after its founding
  and thus belonged to the second generation—something she always mentioned when
  talking about the origins of her IT knowledge. Regardless, she certainly was a
  pro with computers.

  "Now, let's see what this little thing has to offer," she murmured, her eyes
  lighting up. No doubt—she was in her element and grateful for the distraction
  from her everyday routine.

  Grandma's gnarled fingers flew over the keyboard like Angus Young's over the
  strings of his guitar during the solo of "Highway to Hell." "I knew it!" she
  exclaimed shortly afterward. "Everything is encrypted and password-protected.
  Whatever is stored here can not be read easily. Your newspaper customer might
  have been killed because of this stick."

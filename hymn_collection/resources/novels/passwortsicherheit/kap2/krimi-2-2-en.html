<h2>How to Crack a Password</h2>
<br />
<p>But can you crack it...?" Pat asked with admiration and hope.</p>
<p>
  "I think so," Grandma Erika replied. "Believe it or not, the most common
  password is still '12345'. But whoever wrote this stick was a pro. They won't
  make it that easy for us. Still worth a try..."
</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Common Standard Passwords</b></i>
</p>
<p>
  She quickly typed on the keyboard, waited a moment, then abruptly raised her
  hands with palms up, both triumphant and frustrated.
</p>
<p>
  "As expected," she sighed. "None of the usual dummy passwords. I just ran a
  small program that tries the most common passwords, from '12345' and similar
  simple number sequences to 'password,' 'secret,' and other fun stuff that
  includes common first names."
</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Hashes</b></i>
</p>
<p>
  "But there's more to it, right?" Pat asked hopefully. It was more a statement
  than a question. After all, he knew his grandma.
</p>
<p>
  "Of course there's more," she confirmed, smiling. "I'm no longer active in the
  club, but Arnie also still lifts weights at over 70—just to stay in shape. Now
  we'll try a few hashes that have come marketup recently."
</p>
<p>"Hashes?" Pat asked puzzled.</p>
<p>
  "Here's how it works," Grandma said, not taking her eyes off the screen while
  her fingers danced over the keyboard. "All online service providers
  occasionally have security breaches, either through technical errors or greedy
  employees, and as a result, lists of customer passwords regularly end up in
  the hands of hackers."
</p>
<p>"Such as you?" Pat asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>
  "...or my old friends—or their successors," Grandma Erika added. "Anyway, I
  have various older and some newer lists—and don't ask where from!"
</p>
<p>"Why would I!" Pat raised his hands defensively.</p>
<p>
  "The passwords in the lists are coded with randomly generated pseudonyms, so
  you can't just guess them," Grandma continued. "But such 'hashes' can be
  relatively easily determined with some computing power because they are
  created using a unique calculation method. If you simply create a lot of
  passwords and code them into hashes using the same methods, you only have to
  compare the new hashes with those on the list, and as soon as you find a pair
  of identical hashes... Bingo! The plaintext password is on the platter.
  Whoever has this plaintext list knows the passwords of the respective
  customers. And since most people can only remember a limited number of
  different passwords – and therefore use the same or only slightly modified
  ones for various services – the rest can also be quickly guessed with a little
  trial around the known passwords."
</p>
<p>
  She paused briefly and continued typing. "Recycling is a good thing with
  garbage," she continued. "But definitely not with passwords. This is
  especially true since it became fashionable some time ago to change passwords
  regularly. In my opinion, that's nonsense, but it was repeatedly recommended
  and even enforced by software providers for several years. A good password
  doesn't wear out or have an expiration date like raspberry yogurt." She
  chuckled softly. "Knowing that you'll have to change a password soon often
  leads to choosing a simpler one from the start, and then counting up a number
  at the end each time so you don't completely lose track."
</p>
<p>Finally, she turned away from the screen and keyboard and looked at Pat.</p>

<p>
  "Anyway! While my next program tries that out, you can tell me a few more
  details."
</p>

  <b><i>Social Engineering vs. Brute Force</i></b>
</p>
<p>
  When the computer beeped three times and then played a jingle reminiscent of a
  lost bet in the TV show "You Bet!" Pat knew that this attempt to find the
  password for the files on the dead man's USB stick had failed.
</p>
<p>"And now what?" he asked curiously. He knew his grandma wasn't done yet.</p>
<p>
  "Well," she sighed again. "The next step would be 'social engineering.'
  However, this is difficult in this case because the guy is dead, and you
  didn't know him better. Many people create seemingly secure passwords from the
  names of their partners, children, or pets, sometimes combined with their
  birth dates. If you find that out, you're quickly in the system. Often you can
  ask the victims seemingly innocently. But in this case, that's no longer
  possible. You didn't happen to see a cat with a name tag in the apartment, did
  you...?"
</p>
<p>
  "Unfortunately not," Patrick admitted, and then asked, "Is your password
  'Pitti07'?" He remembered how his grandma always bragged about how old budgies
  could get, using her feathered companion as a living example.
</p>
<p>
  "Of course not," she laughed, patting Pat on the shoulder. "But I see you
  understand the principle."
</p>
<p>"So that's it?" Pat asked sadly. "You can't do anything else?"</p>
<p>
  "Don’t give up so quickly," Grandma Erika cautioned. "I didn't say that. If I
  were still in the club, I could run through the dictionaries of all major
  languages, combined with popular appended number combinations and the standard
  substitutions of letters with similar-looking special characters. Like the '1'
  for a lowercase 'l' or the 'at' sign '@' for an 'a'. With that, you can catch
  most personal passwords. But unfortunately, that requires more computing power
  than my machine has. It would take too long. But strange enough, even those
  who should know better often make the same mistakes as most others. This
  means, if someone wants to encrypt a private file, they often choose a private
  password and, although they know it's easier to crack, think this was not the
  case in their specific situation because no one would expect it from someone
  like them. So it could be that our murder victim didn't use a random password
  for these files but one with a personal connection. You didn’t perhaps see
  something in the apartment that could be relevant? Or did he ever talk to
  you?"
</p>
<p>
  "Talk? No. When I deliver the papers, everyone is usually still asleep. And
  even if not, they're busy with other things. But, now that you mention it, he
  had an interesting screensaver—probably self-made."

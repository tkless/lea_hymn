<h2>Slime Molding a Solution</h2>

  "Oh, that's interesting," Grandma exclaimed, beaming like a hunting dog who
  had just picked up a promising scent. "Tell me more: what did it look like?"
</p>
<p>
  "There was a labyrinth that filled the entire screen," Patrick recalled. "And
  something yellow grew from an entrance through the corridors until it almost
  filled the entire labyrinth. But then it withdrew from all the dead ends until
  it was practically only on the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.
  Then it flashed, briefly showing many smiling faces, then flashed again. After
  that, a new labyrinth appeared, and it all started again. Does that mean
  anything to you?"
</p>
<p>
  "I think so," Grandma Erika said thoughtfully. "Let's see..." She opened a
  browser window with a search engine and typed in a few search terms. Shortly
  after, a video clip flickered on the screen, strikingly similar to the
  screensaver.
</p>
<p>
  "Was it something like this?" she asked triumphantly. Pat nodded silently.
</p>
<p>
  "These are slime molds," she explained quickly. "Known for solving labyrinths
  and much more. Researchers have even had them recreate road or subway
  networks. And in terms of resilience, the slime molds were sometimes better
  than human designers."
</p>
<p>"Do you think the password is 'slime mold'?" Pat asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>
  "Could be. We'll try that. But I suspect it's more likely the scientific name.
  This one is... wait... 'Physarum polycephalum'â€”the 'many-headed'."
</p>
<p>"Ah, the smiling faces!" Patrick exclaimed excitedly. "Let's try that!"</p>
<p>
  Grandma Erika tried various versions. The breakthrough finally came with the
  sequence 'p01yCeph@1um'.
</p>
<p>
  "Not bad at all," she praised. "12 characters long, uppercase and lowercase
  letters, numbers, and special characters. But ultimately not secure if you use
  a simple standard algorithm for replacing letters and let the basis for the
  base word constantly flash across the screen. The obvious is not always a good
  hiding place."
</p>
<p>
  "But now let's see what's so valuable that it hides behind slime molds,"
  Grandma Erika said, opening the first decrypted file.
</p>
<p>
  "...and that someone killed for it," Patrick added, shivering at the memory of
  the dead eyes and the knife in his chest.
